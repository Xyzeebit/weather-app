- Real-time weather data from a reliable weather API
- Responsive design for seamless use on various devices
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Automatic location detection for quick weather updates
- Redux integration for state management
- Comprehensive unit testing with Vitest and Testing Library/React
- Deployed to the web using Vercel for easy access

## Technologies Used

- Vite: A fast build tool for modern web development
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state
- Tailwindcss: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- Weather API: A reliable API to fetch real-time weather data
- Vercel: A platform for deploying web applications with ease
- Vitest: A testing tool for Vite applications
- @testing-library/react: A testing utility for React components
